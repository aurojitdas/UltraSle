#Welcome to the UltraSle wiki!

UltraSle is a hybrid framework based on java and selenium that is under development by me. This framework uses Maven build tool for managing the project, TestNg for the tests and ExtentReporter for the reports.

This project is in active development and many more features will be added later on.
